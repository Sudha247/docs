Checklist
=========

The following is a check list of items before any PR branch is created
for trunk:

- [ ] Run tools/check-typo to check for typographic conventions on
      OCaml sources.

- [ ] NO mention or reference to ongoing or upcoming papers (double
      blind policy).

- [ ] All the trunk tests MUST pass, and there should not be any
      failing tests.

- [ ] There should NOT be any errors or warnings from the test
      results.

- [ ] There should NOT be significant performance degradation for
      changes to be pushed to trunk.

- [ ] Ensure all the author(s) are mentioned in the Copyright header
      of source files.

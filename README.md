# README #

The repository is a single source of truth for all our documentation. 

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/prismlab/docs/) for articles authored by prismlab members. 

The docs/ repository content will have all documentation and
links to external references, in the following categories:

* articles/
* papers/
* textbooks/
* tutorials/
* misc/

You can clone the above repository using:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:prismlab/docs.git
```

A `README.md` file under each category folder will contain a list of all
the external references.

Please feel free to create sub-categories as needed. For example, a
compiler section can have sub-categories like parsing, syntax
analysis, code generation, optimization, performance etc.

Use author alphabetical ordering when listing the references.

You are welcome to create your own content ending with the .md
filename extension under the respective categories.

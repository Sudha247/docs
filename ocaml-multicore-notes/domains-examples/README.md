# Domains Examples:

This is a list of experimental code to understande how Domains work in OCaml.

1. **Hello World n:** This code merely prints Hello World from n-different Domains (threads ideologically).
2. **Pi Sequential:** This code illustrates a Sequential algorithm to calculate Pi approximately.
3. **Pi Parallel:** To distribute the work of calculating Pi to multiple Domains.
4. **Trapezoidal Serial:** Serial version of the code to calculate an Integral using Trapezoidal rule.
